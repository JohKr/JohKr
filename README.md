- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohKr
- 👀 I’m interested in SAP EWM and logistics as beeing part of my job. Smarthome is becomming my passion though in private. Just moved into a KNX integrated newly built house in Germany. Made the KNX configuration my selve and installed all KNX non-230V components myself. Just started with Home Assistant as well. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Home Assistant.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Home Assistant and SAP EWM if this on github. :)
- 📫 How to reach me: Just text me via mail.
